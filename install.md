After you have completed the steps in [Installing Prerequisites](install-prerequisites.md), set the Kubernetes context to the cluster where you have installed kpack and Contour.

## <a id="install-package-repo"></a>Install the package repository

To install Application Service Adapter:

1. Create a namespace called `tas-adapter-install` for deploying Application Service Adapter to your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl create ns tas-adapter-install
    ```

1. Create an image pull secret to store your Tanzu Network credentials. These are required so that the cluster can pull images from the Tanzu Network registry.

    ```bash
    tanzu secret registry add tanzunet-registry \
      --username "TANZU-NET-USER" --password "TANZU-NET-PASSWORD" \
      --server registry.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --export-to-all-namespaces --yes \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

    Where `TANZU-NET-USER` and `TANZU-NET-PASSWORD` are your credentials for Tanzu Network.

1. Add the Application Service Adapter package repository to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package repository add tas-adapter-repository \
      --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/app-service-adapter/tas-adapter-package-repo:0.2.0 \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```
1. Verify that the package repository contains the Application Service Adapter package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available list \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

   The output includes the Application Service Adapter package:

    ```bash
    NAME                                          DISPLAY-NAME                 SHORT-DESCRIPTION                                                   LATEST-VERSION
    ...
    application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com  Application Service Adapter  Application Service Adapter for VMware TanzuÂ® Application Platform  0.2.0
    ...
    ```

1. List the installation settings for the `application-service-adapter` package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available get application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com/0.2.0 --values-schema --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

    It should output a list of settings similar to:

    ```

      ...
    ```

## <a id="configure-installation-settings"></a>Configure the installation settings

To configure the installation settings:

1. If you do not already have a certificate and private keypair for HTTPS ingress to the Application Service Adapter API, generate a self-signed certificate.

    If you are using `openssl`, or `libressl v3.1.0` or later:

    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
      -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
      -nodes -subj '/CN=API-FQDN' \
      -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:API-FQDN" \
      -days 365
    ```
    Where `API-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to use to access the API.


    If you are using version `libressl` v3.1.0 or earlier:

    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
      -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
      -nodes -subj '/CN=API-FQDN' \
      -extensions SAN -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[ SAN ]\nsubjectAltName='DNS:API-FQDN'")) \
     -days 365
    ```

    > **Note: `libressl` v3.1.0 is the default version in macOS.

1. If you do not already have a wildcard certificate and private keypair for HTTPS application ingress, generate a self-signed certificate.

    If you are using `openssl`, or `libressl v3.1.0` or later:

    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
      -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
      -nodes -subj '/CN=*.APP-DOMAIN' \
      -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:*.APP-DOMAIN" \
      -days 365
    ```
    Where `APP-DOMAIN` is the FQDN of the shared domain to use for application routes. By default, each application is mapped to a route on a subdomain of this shared domain.

   > **Note:** The TLS certificate for application ingress must be a wildcard certificate.

    If you are using version `libressl` v3.1.0 or earlier:

    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
      -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
      -nodes -subj '/CN=*.APP-DOMAIN' \
      -extensions SAN -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[ SAN ]\nsubjectAltName='DNS:*.APP-DOMAIN'")) \
     -days 365
    ```

    > **Note: `libressl` v3.1.0 is the default version in macOS.


1. Create a `tas-adapter-values.yml` file with the desired installation settings, following the schema specified for the package.

    The following values are required:

    ```yaml
    ---
    api_ingress:
      fqdn: "API-FQDN"
      tls:
        crt: |
          API-TLS-CRT
        key: |
          API-TLS-KEY
    app_ingress:
      default_domain: "DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN"
      tls:
        crt: |
          APP-TLS-CRT
        key: |
          APP-TLS-KEY
    kpack_image_tag_prefix: "KPACK-TAG-PREFIX"
    package_registry_base_path: "PACKAGE-REGISTRY-BASE"
    ```

    Where:

    - `API-FQDN` is the FQDN that you want to use for the Application Service Adapter API.
    - `API-TLS-CRT` is the PEM-encoded public certificate for the Application Service Adapter API.
    - `API-TLS-KEY` is the PEM-encoded private key for the Application Service Adapter API.
    - `DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN` is the shared domain to use for automatically configured application routes.
    - `APP-TLS-CRT` is the PEM-encoded public certificate for applications deployed using the Application Service Adapter.
    - `APP-TLS-KEY` private key for applications deployed using the Application Service Adapter.
    - `KPACK-TAG-PREFIX` is the container image registry "folder"/"project" where droplets (runnable application images) are uploaded.
    - `PACKAGE-REGISTRY-BASE` is the registry "folder"/"project" where packages (application source code) are uploaded.

    The following values are optional:

    ```yaml
    ---
    kpack_cluster_builder_name: "KPACK-CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME"
    scaling:
      cf_k8s_api:
        limits:
          cpu: "API-CPU-LIMIT"
          memory: "API-MEMORY-LIMIT"
        requests:
          cpu: "API-CPU-REQUEST"
          memory: "API-MEMORY-REQUEST"
        replicas: API-REPLICA-COUNT
      cf_k8s_controllers:
        ... #! scaling keys are the same as above
      eirini_controller:
        ... #! scaling keys are the same as above
      hnc_manager:
        ... #! scaling keys are the same as above
      kube_rbac_proxy:
        ... #! scaling keys are the same as above, minus the "replicas" key
    ```

    Where:

   - `KPACK-CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the kpack cluster builder to use for staging. Tanzu Build Service provides two cluster builders named `base` and `default`. To create your own builder, see [Managing Builders](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Build-Service/1.3/vmware-tanzu-build-service-v13/GUID-managing-builders.html) in the Tanzu Build Service documentation, and update this setting with the corresponding builder name.
   - `API-CPU-LIMIT` is the desired CPU resource limit for the pods in the specified deployment.
   - `API-MEMORY-LIMIT` is the desired memory resource limit for the pods in the specified deployment.
   - `API-CPU-REQUEST` is the desired CPU resource request for the pods in the specified deployment.
   - `API-MEMORY-REQUEST` is the desired memory resource request for the pods in the specified deployment.
   - `API-REPLICA-COUNT` is the desired number of replicas for the specified deployment.

   The `requests` and `limits` fields map directly to the resource requests and limits fields on the Kubernetes containers for these system components.
   For more information, see [Resource requests and limits of Pod and container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container) in the Kubernetes documentation.

## <a id="install-adapter"></a>Install the Application Service Adapter

To install the Application Service Adapter:

1. Install the Application Service Adapter to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package install tas-adapter \
      --package-name application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version 0.2.0 \
      --values-file tas-adapter-values.yml \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

1. Verify that the package install was successful:

    ```bash
    tanzu package installed get tas-adapter \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

   The output looks like the following:

    ```bash
    | Retrieving installation details for tas-adapter...
    NAME:                    tas-adapter
    PACKAGE-NAME:            application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com
    PACKAGE-VERSION:         0.2.0
    STATUS:                  Reconcile succeeded
    CONDITIONS:              [{ReconcileSucceeded True  }]
    USEFUL-ERROR-MESSAGE:
    ```
## <a id="configure-tbs"></a>Configure Tanzu Build Service to work with the Application Service Adapter

In order to stage applications, you must create the following secret in the `cf` namespace created by the Application Service Adapter install package.

To configure Tanzu Build Service to work with the Application Service Adapter:

1. Create the image registry secret for Tanzu Build Service:

    > **Note:** This secret is used to push and pull images from the registry specified earlier in the `tas-adapter-values.yaml` file.

    ```yaml
    kubectl create secret docker-registry image-registry-credentials \
      -n cf \
      --docker-server=DOCKER-SERVER \
      --docker-username=DOCKER-USERNAME \
      --docker-password=DOCKER-PASSWORD
    ```

    Where:

    - `DOCKER-SERVER` is the hostname of the container registry to be used for app packages and droplets.
    - `DOCKER-USERNAME` is the username of the account to be used to access the registry.
    - `DOCKER-PASSWORD` is the password of the account to be used to access the registry.

## <a id="configure-dns"></a>Configure DNS for the Application Service Adapter

To configure DNS for the Application Service Adapter:

1. Determine the external IP address to be used for ingress to your cluster. This step varies depending on the IaaS used to provision your cluster.

    For clusters that support LoadBalancer services, you can obtain the external IP address of the LoadBalancer Service.

    ```bash
    kubectl get service envoy -n projectcontour -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}'
    ```

   > **Note:** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, your LoadBalancer has a DNS name instead of an IP address.

1. Create an A record in your DNS zone that resolves the configured API FQDN to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

   > **Note:** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, create a CNAME record that resolves to the DNS name of the load balancer instead of an A record.

1. Create a wildcard A record in your DNS zone that resolves all sub-domains of the configured application domain to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

1. Verify that the Contour HTTPProxy for the API endpoint is valid:

    ```bash
    kubectl get httpproxy cf-k8s-api-proxy -n cf-k8s-api-system
    ```

   The output looks like the following:
    ```bash
    NAME               FQDN       TLS SECRET                STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
    cf-k8s-api-proxy   API-FQDN   cf-k8s-api-ingress-cert   valid    Valid HTTPProxy
    ```

   Target the API endpoint by running `cf api API-FQDN` and start deploying applications. To test the adapter, continue to [Getting Started](getting-started.md).
