# Release notes

This topic contains release notes for the Application Service Adapter for VMware Tanzu Application Platform.

## <a id='0-8-1'></a> v0.8.1 Beta Release

**Release Date**: July 25, 2022

This release is intended for testing and evaluation only. It should not be used to run production workloads.

> **Note**: Platform operators should uninstall Application Service Adapter v0.6 or earlier completely before installing Application Service Adapter v0.8. Application Service Adapter v0.8 no longer correctly recognizes orgs, spaces, and apps created in an installation of that version or earlier.

### Features

* **FIXED**: The Application Service Adapter now configures internal system certificates for its webhooks correctly. This issue may have prevented application instances from being created in v0.7.0 or v0.8.0.

### Components

This release contains the following components:

* Korifi @ [30d68c6](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi/commit/30d68c665efea34cd3e2d51ad90284760961bfa5)
* Eirini Controller @ [aeaddba](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/eirini-controller/commit/aeaddba741fa8193ad3ecdfc2ce1aaf71f8ee6c7)
* kube-rbac-proxy @ [v0.12.0](https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy/releases/tag/v0.12.0)

### Known Issues

* The Application Service Adapter supports only a subset of Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI) commands and options. See [Supported cf CLI Commands](supported-cf-cli-commands.md) for details.
* After unbinding all services from an app, the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable for the app will contain the credentials of the last service to be unbound instead of being empty. As a workaround, an application developer can create a user-provided service instance with empty credentials and bind it to the app to clear out credentials from previously bound services.
* The `cf env` command no longer reports the value of the system-provided `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.


## <a id='0-8-0'></a> v0.8.0 Beta Release

**Release Date**: July 12, 2022

This release is intended for testing and evaluation only. It should not be used to run production workloads.

> **Note**: Platform operators should uninstall Application Service Adapter v0.6 or earlier completely before installing Application Service Adapter v0.8. Application Service Adapter v0.8 no longer correctly recognizes orgs, spaces, and apps created in an installation of that version or earlier.

### Features

* Application developers can obtain a randomly generated route for their app using the `--random-route` flag on `cf push` or the `random-route` key in the application manifest.
* Application processes with a route mapped to them have a port-based health-check by default.
* Platform operators configure the certificate/private key pairs for the Application Service Adapter API and app ingress TLS using Kubernetes secrets instead of certificate and key contents.
* Platform operators opt out of telemetry collection by creating a particular ConfigMap in the underlying Kubernetes cluster, identical to the one used to opt out of telemetry collection for Tanzu Application Platform.


### Components

This release contains the following components:

* Korifi @ [30d68c6](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi/commit/30d68c665efea34cd3e2d51ad90284760961bfa5)
* Eirini Controller @ [aeaddba](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/eirini-controller/commit/aeaddba741fa8193ad3ecdfc2ce1aaf71f8ee6c7)
* kube-rbac-proxy @ [v0.12.0](https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy/releases/tag/v0.12.0)


### Known Issues

* The Application Service Adapter supports only a subset of Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI) commands and options. See [Supported cf CLI Commands](supported-cf-cli-commands.md) for details.
* The Application Service Adapter may fail to create application instances after applications have been started. This issue occurs if the installation process misconfigures one of the internal system certificates.
* After unbinding all services from an app, the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable for the app will contain the credentials of the last service to be unbound instead of being empty. As a workaround, an application developer can create a user-provided service instance with empty credentials and bind it to the app to clear out credentials from previously bound services.
* The `cf env` command no longer reports the value of the system-provided `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.


## <a id='0-7-0'></a> v0.7.0 Beta Release

**Release Date**: June 15, 2022

This release is intended for testing and evaluation only. It should not be used to run production workloads.

> **Note**: Platform operators should uninstall Application Service Adapter v0.6 or earlier completely before installing Application Service Adapter v0.7. Application Service Adapter v0.7 no longer correctly recognizes orgs, spaces, and apps created in an installation of a previous version.


### Features

* Application developers can use `cf logs --recent` to retrieve recent build and runtime logs for applications.
* Application memory allocations match the behavior of Tanzu Application Service, with `M` interpreted consistently as `MiB` (mebibytes). 
* Platform operators can change the default shared domain for application routes.
* Application Service Adapter generates namespaces for CF orgs and spaces entirely via Korifi controllers instead of using the Hierarchical Namespace Controller.
* Application Service Adapter introduces a new `BuildWorkload` resource to represent information required to build an application droplet from a source-code package.
* **FIXED**: Apps that require more than 1024M of memory to start can now set that higher memory allocation with the `-m` flag on `cf push`.

### Components

This release contains the following components:

* Korifi @ [0f9ff9c](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi/commit/0f9ff9cf4212a758e03a84d31a784e9786e5e5ab)
* Eirini Controller @ [b2865ef](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/eirini-controller/commit/b2865ef7e7be705eb9f814e03b07e400277536eb)
* kube-rbac-proxy @ [v0.12.0](https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy/releases/tag/v0.12.0)

### Known Issues

* The Application Service Adapter supports only a subset of Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI) commands and options. See [Supported cf CLI Commands](supported-cf-cli-commands.md) for details.

## <a id='0-6-1'></a> v0.6.1 Beta Release

**Release Date**: May 16, 2022

This release is intended for testing and evaluation only. It should not be used to run production workloads.

> **Note**: Application Service Adapter v0.6.0 was not released publicly.


### Features

* Application environment variables are included in the environment variables set during the application build process.
* Application developers can use `cf unmap-route` to unmap a route from an application.
* Platform operators can configure Application Service Adapter to work with Kubernetes authentication proxies such as Pinniped.
* Platform operators must acknowledge disclosure of the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program policy before installing Application Service Adapter.
* Platform operators can opt out of sending telemetry from the Application Service Adapter installation.
* New `CFOrg` and `CFSpace` custom resources in the Kubernetes API represent orgs and spaces in the Application Service Adapter installation.
* **FIXED**: Running `cf push --no-start` to create a new app will no longer fail with a "Droplet not found. Ensure it exists and you have access to it." error message.
* **FIXED**: Creation of orgs and spaces is now more reliable.

### Components

This release contains the following components:

* Korifi @ [92b8bf8](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi/commit/92b8bf8e078808422baf7de97d41048c1a0076c7)

* Apps that require more than 1024M of memory to start, such as some Java apps, must be scaled up to a suitable memory limit with a separate `cf scale` command after `cf push`.


## <a id='0-5-0'></a> v0.5.0 Beta Release

**Release Date**: April 14, 2022

This release is intended for testing and evaluation only. It should not be used to run production workloads.

### Features

* Application developers can use `cf services` to list the user-provided service instances in the current CF space.
* Application developers can use `cf service` to describe a user-provided service instance.
* Application developers can use `cf unbind-service` to unbind a user-provided service instance from an application.
* Application developers can use `cf domains` to list the shared domains available for routes.
* Application developers can use `cf set-health-check` to set the health-check type on an application or an application process type.
* Application developers can use `cf app` to see CPU and memory usage metrics for the instances of an application.
* Service credentials are presented to bound applications as [filesystem projections](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec#workload-projection) under the service binding root directory.
* The Application Service Adapter enforces authorization rules for API resources. A user must have an admin role or a Space Developer role to push apps and map routes.
* The Application Service Adapter validates that domains do not overlap.
* The Application Service Adapter validates that each route has a non-empty hostname and has a fully qualified domain name that is a valid DNS name.
* The Application Service Adapter validates that paths of routes are well-formed and less than 128 characters in length.
* **FIXED**: `cf delete-service` now deletes any bindings of the service to applications in addition to deleting the service instance.
* **FIXED**: An application containing a capital letter in its name now receives HTTP traffic on its default route.


### Components

This release contains the following components:

* CF K8s API @ [8139c3c](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-k8s-controllers/commit/8139c3c1a162a82ce7e3ee59399422670bc2d5e9)

* Apps that require more than 1024M of memory to start, such as some Java apps, must be scaled up to a suitable memory limit with a separate `cf scale` command after `cf push`.
* The `cf create-org` command may fail with an error message stating that the user is not authorized to perform the action even when the user is an admin. As a workaround, use `cf orgs` to determine whether the operation succeeded. If it did not, try to create the org again.
* Running `cf push --no-start` to create a new app will fail with a "Droplet not found. Ensure it exists and you have access to it." error message. The app will still be created successfully, though, and it can be staged and started with `cf start`.
