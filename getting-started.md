# Getting started with Application Service Adapter

This topic provides an overview of how to get started using the Application Service Adapter for Tanzu Application Platform:

* [Assign the admin role to a user](#assign-admin-user)
* [Create orgs and spaces](#create-orgs-spaces)
* [Deploy a sample app](#deploy-sample-app)
* [Route to an app](#routing-sample-app)
* [Create and bind to a user-provided service instance](#user-provided-services)

## <a id="assign-admin-user"></a>Assign the admin role to a user

After you have installed the Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI), use it to log in to the Application Service Adapter and assign the admin role to an existing user in the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Target the cf CLI at the API endpoint.

    ```bash
    cf api API-FQDN --skip-ssl-validation
    ```

    Where `API-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Application Service Adapter API.

    > **Note:**  If you configured the Application Service Adapter with a globally trusted certificate during installation, you can omit the `--skip-ssl-validation` flag.

1. Log in with the cf CLI.

    ```bash
    cf login
    ```

    The cf CLI detects the user authentication entries in your local Kubeconfig file and presents them for you to select one interactively. Select a user on your target cluster whom you would like to act as an admin.

1. Use the `cf curl` command to determine the subject name of the logged-in user.
   
    ```bash
    cf curl /whoami
    ```

    The output looks like the following:

    ```
    {"name":"my_user@example.com","kind":"User"}
    ```

    The value of the `name` field in the response is the subject name of the user.

    > **Note:** The `kind` field in the output must have the value `User`. If it is some other value, such as `ServiceAccount`, log into the Application Service Adapter with an account for a user in the Kubernetes cluster.


1. Create a `tas-adapter-admin.yaml` file with a RoleBinding definition for the admin user:
   
    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: cf-admin
      namespace: cf
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: CF-ADMIN-USERNAME
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: cf-k8s-api-cf-admin-clusterrole
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

    Where `CF-ADMIN-USERNAME` is the username you determined above.

1. Create the admin RoleBinding in the target cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f tas-adapter-admin.yaml
    ```

## <a id="create-orgs-spaces"></a>Create orgs and spaces

You can use `cf create-org` and `cf create-space` the same way that you do with Tanzu Application Service for VMs. Under the hood, these commands create a Kubernetes namespace for each org and each space, connected into a hierarchy using the Hierarchical Namespaces Controller (HNC). For more information, see the [hierarchical-namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/hierarchical-namespaces) repository on GitHub.

To create orgs and spaces:

1. Create the Cloud Foundry org and space.

    ```bash
    cf create-org ORG-NAME
    cf target -o ORG-NAME
    cf create-space SPACE-NAME
    cf target -s SPACE-NAME
    ```
    Where:

    - `ORG-NAME` is the name of the org you want to create.
    - `SPACE-NAME` is the name of the space you want to create.

1. (Optional) Assign the SpaceDeveloper role to other users in the Kubernetes cluster.

   ```
   cf set-space-role USER-NAME ORG-NAME SPACE-NAME SpaceDeveloper
   ```

   Where `USER-NAME` is the name of another user in the Kubernetes cluster.


## <a id="deploy-sample-app"></a>Deploy a sample app

Use the cf CLI to deploy a sample app to the Application Service Adapter installation.

```bash
cf push APP-NAME
```

Where `APP-NAME` is the name of your app.

## <a id="routing-sample-app"></a>Route to an app

Applications automatically receive a default HTTP route unless pushed with the `--no-route` flag. This default route uses the name of the app as the route hostname.
To configure additional routes for the app that you pushed, use the cf CLI to map a route to your app.

```bash
cf map-route APP-NAME apps.example.com --hostname my-app
```

## <a id="user-provided-services"></a>Create and bind to a user-provided service instance

Service credentials can be provided to apps via [user-provided service instances](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html).

1. First create a user-provided service instance containing the credentials necessary for accessing your service:
  ```bash
  cf create-user-provided-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -p '{"credential-name": "credential-value"}'
  ```
  
  Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of your service instance.
  
1. Bind the service instance to your app
  ```bash
  cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
  ```

1. Restart (or restage if a buildpack relies on the service) the app to make the service credentials available:
  ```bash
  cf restart APP-NAME
  ```

User-provided service instance credentials will be provided to the app and staging tasks in two ways to support both existing TAS applications as well as next-generation frameworks, such as [Spring Cloud Bindings](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bindings):

* As part of the traditional CF [VCAP_SERVICES environment variable](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES)
* As volume mounted secrets in accordance with the [Service Bindings for Kubernetes specification](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#workload-projection)
  * This workload projection is handled by the [Service Bindings Package](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.1/tap/GUID-service-bindings-install-service-bindings.html) from TAP
